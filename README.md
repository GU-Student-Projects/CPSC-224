## Description

This is a repository that contains all of my code for the semester-long project of coding Farkle.
The intended purpose of this repository is to show others what they might be working on when they sign up for this class.
My code is definitely flawed in some way but that's part of the learning experience. 
This has been my favorite computer science course at Gonzaga so far (as a Sophomore) so get excited about taking it!
